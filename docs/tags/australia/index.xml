      <description>After experiencing Brisbane and Gold Coast, it was time to move southwards to Sydney. I&amp;rsquo;d say that this was probably my favourite part of Australia, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty to do as a tourist, although I&amp;rsquo;d hate to live in Sydney due to how much of a nightmare the commute would be. The hostel I was staying at was also good craic, with plenty of fun and interesting people, so it was never a quiet time.</description>

      <description>Quite a bit of time since the last update. I wish I could say I was backpacking with no internet, but unfortunately, after a bad experience in India, I decided to pause my travels for a while, mainly sticking to Europe for a few months. After a bit of soul-searching, I kicked off my travels again with Australia in January, deciding to leave Asia for the future. I&amp;rsquo;m already finished with Australia, so this series of posts will just go over my experience there.</description>
