You've found this site somewhere and now get to read all about me. Congratulations!

### Career

I'm an applied mathematician turned software engineer. I previously studied in NUI, Galway (for far too long), but I managed to escape from academia. You can read all my academic history on LinkedIn on the sidebar.

I used to live in Galway, a city in the west of Ireland, and worked for Cisco, where I primarily used Java, Python, and C++ programming languages.

I've recently completed a round-the-world backpacking trip. I managed to visit a small bit of India, east and south Australia (Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Tasmania), New Zealand, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica, Brazil and Portugal.

### Interests

I hold the usual geek interests you'd expect from a math and I.T. nerd, the main ones being a (near unhealthly) love for sci-fi media together with video and tabletop gaming.
