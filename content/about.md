You've found this site somewhere and now get to read all about me. Congratulations!

I'm an applied mathematician / software engineer who's just recently completed a round-the-world backpacking trip. I managed to visit a small bit of India, east and south Australia (Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Tasmania), New Zealand, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica, Brazil and Portugal. I'm still in the progress of blogging about it.
