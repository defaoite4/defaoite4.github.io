## Introduction

I'm an applied mathematician turned software engineer. I previously studied in NUI, Galway. You can read all my academic history on LinkedIn on the sidebar as well as my [CV here](/public_cv.pdf).

I used to live in Galway, a city in the west of Ireland, and worked for Cisco for almost 3 years. There I worked on the [Jabber desktop/mobile clients](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/unified-communications/jabber/index.html) and the [Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/team-collaboration.html) cloud platform.

I'm currently seeking job opportunities in Europe in similar fields. Please contact me via [email](mailto:jobs@peterwhite.pw) or LinkedIn.
